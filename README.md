# Politricks: Faking Politicians Using Large Language Models

Seminar Project in Social Informatics of Large Language Models, with the goal to assess the capability of state-of-the-art LLM GPT-4 to accurately mimic German parliamentary politician speeches.

## Instructions

The code directory contains the jupyter notebooks needed to recreate our project. Each notebook includes a clarification in its header of who worked on the respective code. The data directory contains some of the data necessary for our project. Since some of our data files are too large for GitHub we have provided them via [cloud storage](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1yq3yDvGVsbSF5npY60mD_34klr36xRjQ) . In order to successfully rerun the code just copy the files from the cloud into their respective subdirectories.
